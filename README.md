### Synopsis

SysInv is a native Windows command line app written in C++ which enumerates hardware and software resources on a local system.
Resources may be output in a number of supported formats including XML, JSON and SNMP Walk style lists.

SysInv aims to be an equivalent Windows counterpart for excellent Linux tools such as [lshw](http://ezix.org/project/wiki/HardwareLiSter) and [dmidecode](http://www.nongnu.org/dmidecode/).
